    <h2>Our Approach</h2>
    <img src="images/Process.png">
    <h3>Initial Exploration</h3>
    <p>From our initial call or meeting, well assess where you currently are on the road to product growth. We’ll produce an assessment and growth plan that will outline areas where you could accelerate your transformation. We might conclude that you’re doing great without us, or we might recommend help in any of our 3 focus areas - Discovery, Delivery or Demand. Our initial exploration is free.</p>
    <h3>Playbooks</h3>
    <p>Our next step is to start researching - you, your clients, the problems you solve in unique ways and the wider demand for those solutions. We’ll collaborate in a number of workshops and validate assumptions in the market. You’ll have a validated playbook that tells you where you are, where you can go and how to get there. Playbooks focus on either Discovery, Delivery or Demand and cost between £5K-£8K each.</p>
    <h3>Mentoring and External Support</h3>
    <p>If you’d like some help taking the next steps towards a high growth product, our mentors can help you through the journey, they can coach guide or just be there to help if you run into sticky problems. Our range of experience means we can help with anything from team creation and building (onsite or remote) to securing new investment. We’re happy to help as much or as little as you like.</p>
